            <h1>Typographic Poster Process Work</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I chose to create a poster for the event "What Happens After The Environment". Since my font is inspired by building blocks, I felt it lended iteself well to the theme of architecture.

                <p>
                   I began by exploring ways the title could be combined to function as an illustration in the poster. I wanted to use the font to suggest some kind of structure or architectural component. I found that the font as it was was difficult to combine and stack becuase of its rounded edges. I went back to some of my earlier illustrations and really liked the blocked out version of the font, which created a more uniform rectangular silhouette for each letter. I though this would help the letters feel more structural.

                <p>
                    Next I played around with the placement of the lettering.
                    I tried a few different things including uniform sizing, grid layout, and stacking. Ultimately I liked the stacking effect because it felt the most architectural.

                <p>
                    The event focuses on Canada's over-development of it's natural environment and resources, how this has contibuted to a climate crisis and other negative consequences, and a possible blueprint for the way forward. With this in mind I decided to de-stabalize the stacked letters and use angles to create a kind of precarious or wobbly assembly. I also added some of the copy into blocks that could be added to the pile. I repeated the title in regualar font as well so that it was a little more obvious at first glance. For colour, my early intention was to create blocks of primary colours that continue the building block theme. In the end, I created a blue-print theme, highlighting just a few of the blocks in white.

                <p>
                   The process of laying out the poster took a very long time. I assumed that using the layout of the original CSS code would make this easier for me, but it actually was very time consuming and limiting. My intention was to create an interactive component to the CSS font in which the white blocks would spin and move when hovered over. However I dicovered that :hover does not work in a position:absolute layout, and so I had to abandon the idea. My next steps would be to simplify the code layout, and to add interactivity.
