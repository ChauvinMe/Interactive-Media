                <p>My site uses the scroll action to allow the user to create their own unique portrait. The user is able to scroll through various facial elements from fine art examples, which are then layered onto their own face to create an abstract composition. </p>

                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>I began by researching websites that were notable for their scrolling behaviour.</p>
                <a href="https://www.are.na/mary-chauvin/webinteractions">I collected some examples on my Are.na site.</a>

                <h2>Scrolling</h2>
                <p>
                   I then started to think about what kind of scrolling was already out there, and how I could use it interactively. A struggle I encountered was that for the most part, scrolling tends to be a passive action, used to get from one part of a page to the next. In order to add interactivity, I started to think about scrolling as a way of choosing between multiple options. Some physical examples of this include the Rubik's Cube, slot machines (not so much choosing in this one), or old cryptex puzzles. From here I started to think about creating a site where the scrolling was a means for the user to choose between multiple options.

                    I began looking at tutorials on scrolling behaviour that might work for my site. Here is a list of sources I used:

                <h2>Scrolling Interactively</h2>
                <p>
                   During my research on scrolling behaviour I stumbled on a tutorial about how to trigger your camera using JS. I started thinking about the idea of creating an interactive portrait in which users could swap out facial features, or add features to their own face. Instagram filters are a good example of this, but I also thought about the aesthetic of abstract portraits, where the facial features look cut-and-pasted together.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                   I decided to create a series of floating "windows" which can be dragged around the page. Each window can be scrolled to access different facial elements, and these elements are categorized by type ex: eyes, mouth etc... Behind these windows appears an image of the user's face, which serves as the canvas on which facial elements can be layered. Scrolling to choose between options, the user can create different combinations of abstract portraits.
