                <p>
                    I began by doing some visual research of existing fonts. I was immediately drawn to block and geometric fonts. My experience so far using HTML and CSS has been about combining individual elements to create a whole picture. With this in mind, I thought it would be interesting to use the same logic to create a font. I decided to create a set of discrete shapes, or elements, that I would use as "building blocks" for my font set. Each letter would be formed by combining a unique combination of elements.

                <h2>Creating Shapes</h2>
                <p>
                    I began by experimenting with simple geometric shapes in Illustrator, and creating different sizes. I tested the shapes by combining them to create letter forms, and seeing which were the most versatile. Once I decided on my final 3 shapes, I combined them to create a lower-case alphabet. My next step was to understand the sizing of each letter, and how each element would factor into the overall size. It took me some time to adjust the sizes of the shapes relative to one another in order to line up the x-heights, and ensure that the font looked balanced.

                <h2>Coding Shapes</h2>
                <p>
                    Once I had completed my alphabet and set my absolute sizing in pixels, I jumped into Sublime Text and began trying to re-create my shapes in CSS. Once I had nailed down each shape, I began constructing each letter. I used position: absolute within each character in order to position my shapes. This took some time... and lots of math! Lastly, I set the colours. I used bright primary colours, and set the opacity to .7 to further reveal the building blocks of each letter.
