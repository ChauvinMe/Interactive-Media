            <h1>1. How To Crit</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="Question-a">
            <h2>What are some challenges you face when giving a critique?</h2>
            <p>I think I have trouble giving critical feedback because I worry about offending people. I also have difficulty coming up with helpful or useful feedback on the spot - sometimes it takes me a bit of time to formulate an opinion about something new. I have also found that giving critique over Teams or ZOOM is particularly difficult because it's less conversational, and because its much harder to connect with people and presentations remotely. Because we all mute ourselves, feedback is often met with complete silence, which is very unnerving.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Question-b">
            <h2>How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?</h2>
            <p>A general rule that try to follow is to never, under any circumstances, argue during a critique. If I disagree with someone's opinion or suggestion about my project, I just thank them and say something like "thats something I hadn't thought of". It allows me time to think about it later and decide whether or not its worth exploring. I've seen people argue or defend their work during a crit and it's never a good thing. Its also important to set an open and welcoming tone, so that everyone feels comfortable offering an opinion.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Question-c">
            <h2>Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques?</h2>
            <p>Receiving critiques is important because we all have our blind spots, especially when it comes to our own work. It's always good to get an outside opinion. I also find that presenting my work to others helps me identify areas of opportunity that I may have overlooked. Giving critiques is important because it helps you practice giving feedback to peers, and to be collaborative. </p>

            <h1>2. What Screens Want</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="Question-d">
            <h2>Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other?</h2>
            <p>Between the two camps, I lean more towards flat design. Early on, when people tended to have little understanding of the capabilities of computer software, skeuomorphic designs were more appropriate, since they functioned as metaphors that signaled the affordances of a program. Chimera uses the wastebasket as an example of how skeuomorphic designs helped teach users how to use a new type of software. These days, depending on your age, most people have a sufficient amount of experience to infer how a a new program or application might function, and so skeuomorphic design isn't necessary. From a design standpoint, I think Skeuomorphs also act as a container, defining the boundaries of what a program can do based on the boundaries of their analog reference - they limit creativity in a limitless environment. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="Question-e">
            <h2>What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</h2>
            <p>A zoopraxiscope is an early filmmaking tool invented by Eadweard Muybridge, in which photographs are printed on a glass disc, which is then spun around a light resulting in a projected image. Similar to a flip book, the quick succession of photographs gives the illusion of movement . The looping nature of the "film" it creates closely resembles a gif. It relates to web and interaction design because the quick succession of images mimics the way ui is prototyped and designed today. Interactions, then, are similar to the zoopraxiscope because they describing the change or movement created by user inputs through an ordered series of screens.Another medium that has influenced digital design is animation. Traditional animation uses the tool of storyboards to create a narrative of scenes. From there, the animator draws each scene and movement independently. When combined, these static units create movement that connect each part of the storyboard together. This is very similar to ui prototyping, in which simple storyboards are created with wireframes, and then each movement is mapped out as a series of screens which connect one interaction to the next.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Question-f">
            <h2>Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.</h2>
            <p>I agree that the grain of screens, as Chimera puts it, is flux. The special quality of screens is that they show change over time by taking inputs and turning them into outputs. When designing for the screen, we are actually designing for change, as well as the way things look. A computer can technically perform its functions without a screen, but the screen is there to show you the process and the outcome, so without flux, the screen has no purpose. </p>

            <h1>3. Turing Complete User</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="Question-g">
            <h2>What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? </h2>
            <p>Lialina discusses the dislike of  'user' by Don Norman and others, and the shift from 'user' to 'people', and 'interface' to 'experience' in public, industry and academic discourse. She also notes that the word 'people', in place of 'user', can be useful in the context of interface design, because it reminds developers to consider those who they are designing for. However, Lialina believes the word 'user' is an important one. Her critique is that the denial of the word 'user' is dangerous: it obscures the fact that programs are created by individuals and companies  with their own agendas. Getting rid of the word 'user' obscures the underlying power structure between user and programmer. Lialina believes that the word 'user' should be preserved because it describes a reality where there is a distinction between users and developers. Further, the word 'user' is imbued with certain rights, such as right to digital privacy or the right to control your own data. Without the category of 'user', Lialina believes we may lose those rights and our ability to fight for them</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Question-h">
            <h2>What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</h2>
            <p>Lialina's ideal user is the Universal User, or General Purpose User. These are users who take advantage of ambiguities in software, use "stupid" networks to their own ends, and create their own interpretations of how a program might be used. As Lialina puts it, Universal users " have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device". Lialina gives the example of using Live Journal as a kind of Twitter, or Twitter to view profiles. The Universal User may be motivated by not knowing a better way, laziness, or simply preference. But in general, they find a way to do what they need to do, in their own way. They challenge the prescribed uses of software as intended by its creators. These users are also visible, and understand themselves as users, and are able to demand their rights as such.</p>

          <div class="Question-i">
            <h2>From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</h2>
            <p>An example of "filling in the gaps" is Futureland, a journal based social media/routine app. It is commonly used to track daily walks, monitor vitamin intake, books, design work etc... Posts are collected in journals and organized according to chronology. There is no "following" system, likes or comments, instead it is open ended collaboration and encourages people to be creative in how they use the functions. There is a public feed for users to share and learn how to use the platform, and there are collaborative features. Users can choose how to engage with the app and each other, and they are free to come up with new uses. </p>

            <h1>4. My Website Is A Shifting House Next To A River Of Knowledge</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="Question-j">
            <h2>Why does Laurel Schwulst (Links to an external site.) advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</h2>
            <p>Schwulst advises that creating your own website allows you to control not only the content, but also the architecture of your site. In other words, you are in control of the context in which your work is presented. She warns that when we use social media or templates to create a site, our content is subordinated to the platform and the agenda of the corporation that owns it. By creating your own website, she says, you are creating your own little world, which is a form of artistic expression. She also makes a larger, more macroscopic argument that hand-coding is a "radical act". Since large corporations and social media are increasingly in control of defining what the web should be, by creating a personal website you can help "steer the web back to its original architecture". Shwulst believes that the web should work for people, and therefore that people, not large corporations, should guide its future. Personal websites contribute to this vision, she says, because they challenge what a website could be, and therefore challenge the dominant narrative of how to present your work, as defined by large platforms.I mostly agree with Schwulst. On the one hand, I think template options and social media have democratized the ability to show your work, since not everyone gets the opportunity to learn to code. However, its obvious that this has had a homogenizing effect not only in how work is presented, but on content as well. Dominance of a single web architecture will ultimately have an effect on the content of peoples work, since work will be created for that format. We can already see this with the influence that Instagram has had on the square format in photography. Therefore, creating your own website on which you show your work opens up new possibilities for artistic expression that are not bound by mainstream platforms.</p>

            <h2>In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.</h2>

            <h1>5. The Poetry Of Tools</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="Question-l">
            <h2>In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</h2>
            <p>Most of us use technology as a tool, in other words, without reflecting on the tool itself beyond how it can perform a task. I think Seu is inviting the reader to forget about the task, and instead be conscious of the tool for its own sake, in terms of its aesthetic, function and historic use. This means thinking about the possibilities of tools beyond utility, and also about how the limitations of our tools impact the structure and look of the web. I think she is posing the question: if, for example, you had never used a mouse/cursor before - what formal elements, structures and gestures might you notice?Seu calls technology a tool, but also a language. Language can be used as a tool to accomplish goals, for example communicating a set of instructions. I think Seu relates "defamiliarizing tools" with poetry because both use the limitations and structures of tools to create something that is not purely functional. For example a person creating a Haiku or a rhyming verse would be reflecting on the syllables and phonemes that make up words in order to create a poem. The same could be said about Seu's example of Emilio Gomariz's work, in which the formal elements of Adobe Illustrator are re-arranged to create a visual composition.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Question-m">
            <h2>Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</h2>
            <p>One of Seu's 6 categories is called Performing Data. Data visualization is about organizing and presenting data in such a way that it is understandable. Performing Data goes a step beyond this where the format of the visualization itself is informed by the content of what it is presenting, and may even be a critique of it.
            Seu gives the example of the performance piece, A Sort of Joy, in which the MOMA collections database was performed aloud. In this case the artwork was the data, but the unconventional visualization of Sort of Joy goes beyond traditional visualization to question how artwork can be consumed. 

            Another example of this is New York Public Library's digital artifact database http://publicdomain.nypl.org/pd-visualization/. Here, the NYPL has taken digitized versions of prints and other artifacts, and compiled them into a single database as high resolution images. Visitors can view the entire collection of 187k items as a collage on their screen. They can re-organize the images based on date, collection, genre and even colour, to create new visual combinations. Hovering over specific works triggers a zoomed-in clickable version. The site's collage organization communicates the vast size of the collection all at once, rather than being hidden behind a traditional search engine interface. It questions how these works can be consumed, and transforms the data into something beyond the sum of its parts.</p>
